                    <p class="text-muted text-left">When I started primary school, I couldnâ€™t believe that so many books were kept in one room and were available for us to borrow and read. Every week I used to borrow two books- one fiction and another reference book. After finishing them,i would borrow many different types of books.I loved the dignity of the place. To be able to read anything in such a quiet, calm, and peaceful environment was like a taste of heaven.</p>

                        <p>At the start of the game, the referee tossed the ball at the center of the court between two players. One player from our team try to get their hands on the ball and the ball is passed on to the teammates of our team. For scoring a point, our team needs to shoot the ball through the basket. Then a shot is scored from a distance that is closer to the basket than the 3 point line than it fetches 2 points. Also, if the ball is shot from the distance behind 3 point line, it fetches 3 points. So, the team that has a maximum number of points was declared the winner. </p>
